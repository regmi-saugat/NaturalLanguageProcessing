- Topic modelling is an unsupervised machine learning method that helps us discover hidden semantic structures in a paper, that allows us to learn topic representations of papers in a corpus. The model can be applied to any kinds of labels on documents, such as tags on posts on the website.

- The most common approach for topic modeling is **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**. LDA assumes that documents are generated from a mixture of topics, and each topic is represented by a distribution of words. The algorithm tries to find the optimal set of topics and their corresponding word distributions that best explain the observed data.
