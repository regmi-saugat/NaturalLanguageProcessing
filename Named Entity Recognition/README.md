## Named Entity Recognition 

- Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities in a text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, and others. 

- The goal of NER is to extract structured information from unstructured text data and represent it in a machine-readable format. Approaches typically use BIO notation, which differentiates the beginning (B) and the inside (I) of entities. O is used for non-entity tokens.
